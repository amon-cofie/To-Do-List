# To-Do-List

> In this "To-Do-List" project, I created the basic structure of a page single page application with HTML, CSS and javascript, using the webpack bundler to bundle all the source files in the "src" folder into the "dist" folder for distribution.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Webpack

## Live Demo

### [See the project live](https://amon-cofie.github.io/To-Do-List/)

## Getting Started

This project is high-fidelity wireframe of a to do list web app. You can open the live link to view it or you can make a copy to personalize it.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites

- Code editor
- Install Git
- Command Line Interface
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript
- Web browser
- webpack
- npm

### Setup

- Open your command line and change directory to the destination on your local computer where you want your copy to be stored (You can use the terminal in VS code).
- Copy this command to your command line or terminal: **git clone https://github.com/amon-cofie/To-Do-List.git**
- Change directory to the repository. You can use this command in the command line: **cd To-Do-List**
- The content of the repository should appear in the your code editor at this point if you are using the inbuilt terminal.
- You can open the repository from git bash in VS code at this point with the following command: **code .**
- You should make any desired changes in the "src" folder and try as much as possible not to change the configurations in the package.json and webpack.config.js files
